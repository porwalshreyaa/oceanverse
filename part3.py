# 33. Write a function called add that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. (1 point)

# 34. Write a function called factorial that takes an integer n and returns the factorial of n. (1 point)

# 35. Write a function called fibonacci that takes an integer n and returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence. (1 point)

# 36. Write a function which simulates the process of throwing n
# identical balls into n

# bins. What is the maximum across the buckets? Write a short report on the output of your code. (2 points)

# 37. Write a function which simulates the process of throwing identical balls into n

# identical bins until all the bins are non-empty. How many balls are we expected to throw? Investigate and write a short report based on your observation. (2 points)

# 38. Checking for Even or Odd: Write a function called is_even that takes an integer and returns True if the number is even, and False if it is odd. (1 point)

# 39. Calculate Area of a Circle: Write a function called circle_area that takes the radius of a circle as an argument and returns its area. (1 point)

# 40. Write a function that displays the spiral: RULLDDRRRUUULLLLâ€¦ and so on. It should keep displaying until it has displayed 1,000,000 Letters in this pattern. (5 points)

# 41. Concatenating Strings: Write a function called concatenate that takes two strings and returns them concatenated together with a space between them. (1 point)

# 42. Finding the Maximum: Write a function called find_max that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest number in the list. (1 point)

# 43. Consider the sensex data from here. Consider only the end of the day closing values. When should you have bought and when should you have sold in order to gain the maximum return in this 30 year period? You can assume that you can buy the stocks partially and you start with, let us say 1,00,000 Rupees. (10 points)

# 44. Consider the data of Height and Weight of 25,000 people as available here. Is the data correlated? What is the correlation? Can you plot the points and fit a line? You are free to use any built in functions, but you should know what the functions are doing. Correlation is a statistical concept which you may know from your high school, we only expect you to understand this concept at an intuitive level. (5 point)
